# HaskellSudoku
Program which should solve sudku problem 

- in the solution I use the backtracking algorithm idea, a detailed description of which can be found on the following pages:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sudoku-backtracking-7/

- The project assumes that the content of the sudoku to be solved is in a text file, the path to which
- will be given as an argument to the program. The format of saving sudoku in the file is as follows:
- consecutive rows are given on separate lines
- numbers in rows are separated by at least one space
- a blank cell is represented by the number 0

- The sudoku solution will be displayed on the standard output
